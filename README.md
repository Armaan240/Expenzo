# Expenzo ðŸ’¸

- Expenzo is a simple 8bit retro style and interactive web app to track your expenses and manage your budget in a fun and visual way.
---
## Why We Made This
---
- Managing expenses can be boring and confusing, especially for students and beginners. We wanted to create a lightweight tool that makes tracking expenses easy, visual, and enjoyable. Plus, it was a great opportunity to experiment with **React** and **Vite** while participating in HackClub activities.
